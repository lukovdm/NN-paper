# NN-paper
Code for my paper on neural networks

## Training
Make sure you have [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) installed.
Run the `MNIST.py` script with python3, it should start training.
Summaries are stored in `/tmp/NN-summaries`.
It will run on the CPU.

## Running
In the code of `MNIST_trained.py` there is a path defined for an image. This is the path to the input image.
A summary is also stored in `/tmp/NN-summaries`.
The trained script uses the `MNIST.ckpt`file.
